<h1>PC Build</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this PC Build I will share some of the process of building my PC. I orginally had a pre built PC from Micro Center in 2019, where I replaced/upgraded various parts over the years. I started off in 2021 replaceing the CPU, Cooler, RAM and MotherBoard, then getting a new case and PSU while upgrading my HDD, and lastly getting a new GPU. Eventually 2 years later in 2023 my SSD was beginning to fail which was my boot drive, so I had to go through the process of replacing the drive and mainting the operating system.
